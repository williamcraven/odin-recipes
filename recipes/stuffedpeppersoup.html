    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1 lb ground turkey</strong>. You can use beef or chicken if you'd like.</li>
      <li><strong>1 medium onion</strong>, chopped. Any type will do.</li>
      <li><strong>3 medium bell peppers</strong>, chopped. I've added up to 4 peppers, and it's yummy!</li>
      <li><strong>14.5 oz can diced tomatoes</strong> include liquid.</li>
      <li><strong>15 oz can tomato sauce</strong></li>
      <li><strong>1/2 cup dry brown rice</strong> short grain.</li>
      <li><strong>2 cups chicken broth or water</strong></li>
      <li><strong>1 clove minced garlic</strong></li>
      <li><strong>2 tsp oregano</strong></li>
      <li><strong>1/4 tsp pepper</strong></li>
      <li><strong>1/8 tsp salt</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Pressure Cooker:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Saut√© the ground turkey until no longer pink. Drain liquid, if necessary.</li>
      <li>Add all of the other ingredients to the pressure cooker. Close the lid and seal your vent.</li>
      <li>Cook on high pressure for 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Quick pressure release. If you'd like to let the pressure release naturally for a few minutes, it'll be fine sitting there.</li>

      <li>Brown the ground turkey in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add the ground turkey, broth, tomatoes, tomato sauce, chopped peppers and onion, black pepper, garlic, oregano, and salt to the Crock Pot.</li>
      <li>Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours.</li>
      <li>Add your uncooked rice about 1 hour before cook time is finished. You can also cook rice separately and add it right before serving.</li>
    </ol>
