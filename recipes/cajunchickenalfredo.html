      <li><strong>2 tsp olive oil</strong></li>
      <li><strong>2 tsp Cajun seasoning</strong></li>
      <li><strong>3 cups water</strong></li>
      <li><strong>4 cups whole grain pasta</strong></li>
      <li><strong>2/3 cup cheese parmesan</strong></li>
      <li><strong>3/4 cup cottage cheese 2%</strong></li>
      <li><strong>3/4 cup Greek yogurt 2%, plain</strong></li>
      <li><strong>2 tsp garlic powder</strong></li>
      <li><strong>1/4 tsp pepper</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <h3>Stove top:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Coat your chicken breasts with olive oil and Cajun seasoning.</li>
      <li>Heat a large skillet on high heat on the stove.</li>
      <li>When the skillet is hot, sauté the chicken on each side for 2-3 minutes until it gets crispy. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</li>
      <li>Add the water to the skillet and deglaze your pan.</li>
      <li>Add pasta to the water and give a quick stir.</li>
      <li>Move the chicken back to the pot and set on top of the pasta.</li>
      <li>Bring the water in the skillet to a boil, then cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium low, so that the liquid keeps simmering. Cook for 12-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta and chicken are cooked through.</li>
      <li>While the pasta is cooking, blend together the cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, garlic powder and pepper to make your alfredo sauce. Set aside until ready to use.</li>
      <li>When your chicken is cooked through, remove and slice.</li>
      <li>Pour your alfredo sauce and parmesan cheese over the pasta and stir until it’s combined.</li>
      <li>Serve warm and top with the sliced chicken.</li>
